        when subclassing this class or adding custom rules to an

        The intended usage is that this class is sub-classed to create

        part of the subclass, they must be flagged with the 'rule'
        decorator - see above.

        a hierarchical series of tokens. The parse method calls
        whichever function is indicated by self.main, unless otherwise
        instructed.

        module for more information on this. If no handler is passed,
