I've got some experience, mostly acquired through self-study. I would describe myself as a confident Python user. I've created a few small projects myself, including a simple web-scraping program and a parser generator for Backus-Naur form grammars. As an environmental consultant, I've found ways to use Python in the office - in this context I've mostly used programming for data analysis and data sanitisation. However, I also put together a small program designed to transfer data from Microsoft Excel to Word. Finally, I've taken part in a Kaggle contest with a friend using Python.

Through my current role I've become fairly proficient in VBA, used in conjunction with Microsoft Excel. I have learnt C programming and have written a few short programs, including a solver for Snatch (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9556/snatch) and a simple parser capable of validating HTML. 

I've used Git for some of my own projects and I'm familiar with the basics of SQL and HTML. I've also got some experience with Linux, having purchased a few Raspberry Pi micro-computers. One of these has become a music server attached to my dad's sound system!
