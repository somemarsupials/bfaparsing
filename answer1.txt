I've spent two years teaching myself Python and some of the core concepts behind computing, while working as an environmental consultant. In my current role, I focus mainly on developing energy-oriented models and understanding the electricity grid of the future. I really enjoy writing code in my spare time and, while I occasionally use code in the office, I think that I would be much happier in a position where I am employed to develop software. I would ideally like to do something involving machine learning but I would be delighted with any software development role. 

The Makers Academy is a highly regarded programme and a place on the course would be a really strong step into the industry. I like the fact that the curriculum includes a number of languages and technologies with which I'm unfamiliar. More importantly, I understand that the Makers Academy aims to teach people how to do things 'properly'. It is relatively easy to learn languages at home but it is much harder to learn the disciplines and best practice expected in a professional context; examples including TDD, collaboration, security and documentation. For this reason, the Makers Academy would be an ideal entry point into the world of development.

Finally, I like that fact that the course features projects and talks with people from the industry. I see this as a really useful opportunity to gain a portfolio and potentially meet interesting people.
